# Music-Recommendation-System

# Overview
This Music Recommendation System utilizes facial expression analysis to recommend music that aligns with the user's emotional state. By leveraging computer vision technology, the system captures and analyzes facial expressions in real-time, providing personalized music recommendations tailored to the user's mood.

# Features
Facial Expression Analysis: The system uses a pre-trained facial expression recognition model to detect and interpret the user's emotional state based on their facial expressions.

Real-time Processing: The application processes facial expressions in real-time, ensuring dynamic and responsive music recommendations.

Integration with Spotify (or your preferred music platform): Seamlessly integrates with popular music platforms to fetch and play recommended songs.

User-friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive user interface that displays the detected emotional state and recommended music, creating a delightful user experience.

Customizable Settings: Users can customize the sensitivity of the facial expression analysis and other settings to fine-tune the recommendations according to their preferences.

# Prerequisites
